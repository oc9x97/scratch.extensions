# Scratch Extensions
So, have you ever seen those Scratch extensions you can import in Turbowarp? Well I made my own! Since I am a script kiddie most are coded with ChatGPT, Sorry!

# Extensions
**IP Editor** - Mainly made for logging IP's.

# How To Import
**You can't do it on standalone Scratch so use Turbowarp or PenguinMod.**  
**Create a project using one of those Scratch softwares.**  
**Go to extensions and find where you can load a custom one.**  
**Paste in the extension code in text, or give it the raw URL.**
